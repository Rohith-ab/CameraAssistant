# CameraAssistant

Camera assistant where you can pan the camera a bit (movement of around 2 inches wide) which will capture multiple frames and gives you 3 best pics with corrections (filters, colour corrections, alignment etc.) to choose from. You can re-visit the original photo and edit it to make it horizontal frame if needed.

# Bringing it to life

We are just an idea at this moment, we would like to take advantage of Googleâ€™s on/off device ML to check popular photos from Google database and produce 3 best matching results based on the popularity of the reference image.
